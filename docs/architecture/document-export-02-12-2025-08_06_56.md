# AWS Serverless Exam Application Architecture

Create an AWS architecture diagram for a serverless exam application with the following components:

**Frontend & Content Delivery:**

- Users access via web browsers (desktop/mobile)
- Route53 DNS with custom domain (aws-exams.matthewntsiful.com for prod, saa-exams-dev.blakkbrother.com for dev)
- CloudFront CDN distribution with OAC (Origin Access Control)
- S3 bucket for static website hosting (HTML, CSS, JS, exam files)
- Separate S3 bucket for access logs
**Security Layer:**

- AWS WAF attached to CloudFront (rate limiting + managed rules)
- SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, XSS Protection)
**Application Architecture:**

- Node.js/Express backend serving EJS templates
- 16 exam HTML files with embedded JavaScript
- Client-side data storage using browser localStorage
- PWA with service worker for offline support
**Infrastructure Management:**

- Terraform for IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- S3 bucket for Terraform remote state
- DynamoDB table for state locking
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with OIDC authentication
**Monitoring:**

- CloudWatch alarms for monitoring
- CloudFront access logs
- S3 access logs with lifecycle policies (30d → IA, 90d → Glacier, 365d delete)
**Environments:**

- Dev environment (develop branch auto-deploy)
- Production environment (main branch auto-deploy)
Show data flow from user request through CloudFront, WAF, to S3, and back to user. Include GitHub Actions deployment flow to both environments.

Use AWS standard icons and colors. Group resources by function (security, content delivery, storage, monitoring, CI/CD).
